# CLAUDE.md — hiagents (product repo)

Read this before making changes. The goal is to keep future sessions from re-introducing things we've already decided against.

## What this repo is

**hiagents** is a multi-tenant SaaS that auto-replies to customer email using a PDF-backed knowledge base. The first (and currently only) agent is **Inbox**. One deployment serves N tenants — anyone with a Google account can sign in, a workspace is auto-provisioned, they connect Gmail, drop PDFs, and the bot starts replying within 60s.

Live at: **`bot.aiagencycorp.com`** (configurable — see "Deploy domain" below).
Marketing site: separate repo `hiagents-digital` → **`hiagents.digital`** (waitlist-only).

The repo folder + GitHub remote are still named `inbox-ai` for historical reasons; the brand is `hiagents`. Folder rename + GitHub repo rename are operator chores outside what this codebase can do automatically.

## Run / build / test

```bash
npm install           # Node 20+, has undici as an explicit dep
npm run dev           # tsx watch src/server.ts
npm run build         # tsc + copy src/ui → dist/ui
npm test              # vitest run (61 unit + 13 integration; see "Tests" below)
```

## Architecture in one screen

```

                └─ /health             src/routes/health.ts

Cron (node-cron) ── src/workers/poller.ts ── runs every POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS
                                              ├─ listOnboardedTenants() — slim projection (id + settings)

                                              └─ processTenant → listUnreadInbox → for each: fetchMessage → runPipeline

Cron (node-cron) ── src/workers/cleanup.ts ── daily 03:00 UTC, hard-deletes soft-deleted tenants > 30d

Pipeline (src/pipeline/run.ts):
  loop-guard → thread-guard → assertEmailQuota → isFromSelf / isSystemSender →
  assertPerSenderReplyQuota → assertDailySpendCap → fetchThreadMessages →
  Promise.all([classify, assessInboundRisk]) → search (pgvector) →
  generateReply → moderateOutbound → sendReply → write `messages` row

Data (Supabase Postgres):
  tenants, memberships, oauth_tokens, kb_documents, kb_chunks (pgvector),
  messages, llm_usage, audit_log  — every per-tenant table has `tenant_id` + RLS
```

## Things to NOT reintroduce

Each of these has been intentionally removed or never added. If you find yourself about to add one back, check the FEATURES.md / SAFETY-AUDIT.md entries first — there's usually a "🚫 Removed YYYY-MM-DD — reason" line explaining why.

- **Gmail labels** (`hiagents/replied`, `…/skipped`, `…/failed`). The poller used to apply these; we removed them because they pollute the user's mailbox visually. Same status info is on each `messages` row + the Activity dashboard.
- **`markRead`** on processed emails. Same reason as labels but worse — silently changing the unread count messes with the user's primary inbox signal. Dedupe is handled by `runPipeline`'s `messages.gmail_message_id` idempotency check.
- **Per-tenant model dropdown** (reply / classifier model). Operator-controlled in `defaultTenantSettings()`. Predictable cost + quality across the platform.
- **Per-tenant retrieval-tuning UI** (similarity threshold + top-K). Operator knobs, not user-facing decisions. Defaults of 0.3 / 5 work for everyone. The Zod schema still accepts them via direct PUT for operators who want to override.
- **`ADMIN_PASSWORD` / password-fallback login**. Google sign-in is the only path in. Use `SESSION_SECRET` for HMAC and `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for AES-256-GCM token-at-rest.
- **`inbox-ai` brand**. Renamed to `hiagents` everywhere in user-facing copy. Cookies are `hiagents_admin` / `hiagents_csrf` / `hiagents_oauth_state`. Log service is `hiagents`. The repo folder + git remote still say `inbox-ai` historically — that's the only place it should remain.
- **Pricing page on the marketing site** while we're pre-launch. Add it back once there are customers to anchor pricing from.
- **Sign-in CTA on the marketing site**. The marketing site is waitlist-only until the app is fully ready. Don't link `hiagents.digital` to `bot.aiagencycorp.com`.
- **Blanket "no code / shell commands" rule in the moderator**. False-positives on legitimate devtools answers. The current rule is specific — remote-exec pipes, destructive commands, credential exfiltration. See "Moderation calibration" in SAFETY-AUDIT.md section 4.

## Patterns to follow

- **Error envelope**: every JSON API failure goes through `sendError(res, status, { code, message, internal? })` from `src/lib/errors.ts`. Never `res.status(500).json({ error: e.message })` — that leaks stack traces. The UI's `safeFetch` in `admin.html` / `onboarding.html` reads `message` and shows it verbatim, so write messages for end-users, not developers.
- **Audit writes from routes**: use `auditFireAndForget(...)` (not `await audit(...)`) in request handlers — keeps responses fast. The original `audit(...)` is for cron / batch paths where the surrounding process might exit before a detached write would land.
- **CSRF**: every state-changing route (POST/PUT/DELETE) must have the `csrfGuard` middleware after `requireAdmin`. The UI's `safeFetch` echoes the cookie automatically; no per-call work needed on the client.
- **Header sanitization on outbound mail**: anything that ends up in a raw RFC 2822 header MUST go through `sanitizeHeader()` / `sanitizeMessageId()` in `src/providers/gmail.ts`. Don't string-interpolate user-controlled values into header lines.
- **Token storage**: never read or write `oauth_tokens.access_token` / `refresh_token` without going through `encryptToken` / `decryptToken` in `src/lib/crypto.ts`. The format is `v1:base64(iv || tag || ciphertext)` with random per-encrypt IV. Legacy plaintext rows (no `v1:` prefix) are opportunistically re-encrypted on next read by `loadStoredTokensForTenant`.
- **Tenant scoping**: every query that touches a per-tenant table is filtered by `tenant_id` in code. RLS is on as defense-in-depth but app-code paths use the service role key (bypasses RLS). Use `tenantScoped()` in `src/tenant/scoped.ts` where it fits; integration test in `tests/integration/tenant-isolation.test.ts` verifies isolation under `TEST_SUPABASE=1`.
- **In-process caches** (tenant lookup 30s TTL, undici socket pool 32/origin): both invalidate / cap correctly already. If you add new caches, document the TTL and the invalidation hook.

## Deploy domain

The canonical hostname is stored in `.deploy-domain` and used in docs / examples / `.env.example`. To swap to a different deployment hostname:

```bash
scripts/set-deploy-domain.sh app.hiagents.digital
```

The script handles three patterns in one pass — singleton (`bot.aiagencycorp.com`), multi-client dash (`bot-acme.…`), multi-client placeholder (`bot.<client-slug>.…`) — and updates `.env.example`, `README.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, `docs/GMAIL-OAUTH-SETUP.md`, `docs/nginx-vhost.conf.example`. Runtime config is env-driven (`BASE_URL` / `DOMAIN` / `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`) and intentionally untouched — operator updates `.env` on the VPS separately. Privacy/ToS URLs (`hiagents.digital/privacy`, `…/terms`) are NOT touched because they're marketing-site URLs.

## Onboarding

4 visible steps: **Set up → Gmail → Knowledge → Review**. The "Set up" card combines workspace name + persona + classifier prompt into one form with one Continue button (POSTs fired in parallel). Workspace name is the only required field; everything else is optional with sensible defaults. See `docs/ONBOARDING-FLOW.md` for the routing logic + step-done computation table.

`tenant.settings.persona.configured: boolean` is set by the persona POST and is what drives `steps.persona = true` — don't tie that flag to `companyDescription` again (it's optional now).

## Security model

Most of this is detailed in `docs/SAFETY-AUDIT.md` (Sections 1–11 + 12 verified edge cases + 13 unverified). The session-state primitives:

- **Session cookie** `hiagents_admin` — HMAC-SHA256, 7-day server-side max-age check (rejects leaked-but-unrotated cookies even if HMAC valid).
- **CSRF cookie** `hiagents_csrf` (non-httpOnly) — HMAC-signed nonce echoed via `X-CSRF-Token` header.
- **OAuth state cookie** `hiagents_oauth_state` (httpOnly, 10-min, `/oauth` path) — defends `/oauth/callback` against forged-callback phishing.
- **AES-256-GCM at rest** for OAuth tokens via `src/lib/crypto.ts`.

## pm2

Manifest at `ecosystem.config.cjs`. `kill_timeout: 20000` must be ≥ `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS` (15000) in `src/server.ts`, otherwise pm2 will SIGKILL mid-drain on `pm2 reload`. The server installs SIGTERM + SIGINT handlers that stop accepting new connections and drain in-flight requests for up to 15s before exiting.

## Tests

`npm test` runs vitest. 7 unit + 1 integration file. Notable:

- `tests/integration/safety-guards.test.ts` makes live LLM calls (requires `.env.local` with real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` + Supabase). Skipped by default in CI; runs locally.
- `tests/unit/crypto.test.ts` requires `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to be **exactly 32 bytes** base64-decoded. If you see 6 crypto failures, your local env has a wrong-sized key — regenerate with:
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
  ```
- `tests/integration/tenant-isolation.test.ts` runs under `TEST_SUPABASE=1` against a real Supabase test project.

When you change `src/pipeline/moderate.ts` (especially adding / removing rules), add a matching integration test case — both an OK case and a FLAGGED case — so we don't drift back into false-positives.

## Marketing repo

`hiagents-digital` is a separate Next.js Vercel project. Its claims are sourced from this repo's `docs/FEATURES.md` + `docs/SAFETY-AUDIT.md`. Rule: **only put a tile / claim on the marketing site if the corresponding row here is ✅ Shipped**. Aspirations belong on the roadmap, not the landing page. Currently waitlist-only — pricing + sign-in CTA removed until traction proves the price points.
